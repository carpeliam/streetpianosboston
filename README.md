Boston Piano Finder
===================

An app to track which of the [Boston Street Pianos](http://streetpianos.com/boston2013/) you've played. Uses `localStorage` to keep track across sessions, and sorts by distance (using the Haversine formula, so it's closest as the crow flies, not via driving directions, so maybe not as useful in Boston as you'd like?).

The [Boston Street Pianos](http://streetpianos.com/boston2013/) are leaving on Monday October 14th, so hurry up and play them all!
